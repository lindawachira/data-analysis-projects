### Heyyy...thank you for coming this far ðŸ‘‹

This repository carries projects that I have worked on across different domains.

While I may not have deep domain expertise in every industry, Iâ€™ve developed strong research skills that allow me to quickly understand the context of any dataset I work with. This adaptability has enabled me to analyze data across various domainsâ€”from economics to public healthâ€”and still extract meaningful, accurate, and actionable insights.

I believe that good data analysis is driven not only by technical skills, but also by the ability to ask the right questions and dig into the surrounding context when needed.
