# Hello and Welcome!

This repository is a testament to a simple belief: a great analyst is defined not by pre-existing domain knowledge, but by the ability to learn it quickly and thoroughly. Here, you'll find my journeys into diverse fields—from **finance** and **marketing**, and more...where I've applied a structured, analytical approach to uncover insights and drive decisions.

Each project is a case study in connecting data to context. I start with the fundamentals: understanding the problem, asking pointed questions, and rigorously cleaning and exploring the data. The result is a portfolio that demonstrates not just technical proficiency in **Power BI, SQL, and DAX**, but also the strategic thinking to know what to build and why.
